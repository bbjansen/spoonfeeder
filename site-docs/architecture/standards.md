## Built Into Every Project

These standards are implemented in the base template and included in every generated project automatically.

## Available via Recipes

These standards are available when the corresponding recipe is selected. They are grouped by category below.

| [OpenAPI 3.x](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html) | Machine-readable API description format for REST APIs | `swagger` | API documentation via `@nestjs/swagger` |

### Caching

Standards that govern HTTP caching behavior and conditional request handling.

| Standard | What it does | Recipe | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [RFC 9111](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9111) | Defines HTTP caching rules — `Cache-Control`, freshness, validation | `http-caching` | `Cache-Control`, ETag, conditional `If-None-Match` / `If-Modified-Since` |

### Observability

## Operational Standards

| Concern | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| Request Timeout | Middleware aborts requests exceeding `REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 30,000 ms), returns 408 |
| Graceful Shutdown | `enableShutdownHooks()` drains in-flight requests, closes DB/queue connections |
| Health Check Probes | `/health/live` (liveness), `/health/ready` (readiness), `/health/startup` (startup) via `@nestjs/terminus` |
| SSRF Prevention | Outbound HTTP calls validated against allow-listed hosts; private/link-local IP ranges blocked |
| Input Sanitization | `ValidationPipe` with `whitelist: true` strips unknown properties |
| Connection Pool Management | ORM pool sizes configurable via environment variables; pool exhaustion logged |

## Recommended Practices

These are not specific RFCs but are industry-standard practices followed by the boilerplate.

| Practice | Reference | Implementation |
