# Recipe System

Recipes are the building blocks of a spoonfeeder project. Each recipe encapsulates a single capability — a database integration, an auth strategy, a cloud service — and ships everything needed to use it: dependencies, source files, configuration, environment variables, tests, and AI context.

## Recipe Lifecycle

Each recipe passes through a defined lifecycle during project generation:

    A[Define] --> B[Select]

    C --> D[Copy Templates]
    D --> E[Merge Deps]
    E --> F[Inject main.ts]
    F --> G[Write Manifest]

```

## How Recipes Work

When you select a recipe during scaffolding, spoonfeeder:

1. **Adds dependencies** to `package.json` with exact versions (no `^` or `~`)
2. **Generates source files** from templates into the correct directories
3. **Registers modules** in `app.module.ts`
4. **Adds environment variables** to `.env.example` and per-environment `.env` files
5. **Generates test files** in the `tests/` directory
6. **Updates AI context** in `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/rules/project.mdc`, and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

## Conflicts and Requirements

Recipes declare their relationships explicitly:

- **Conflicts** — Recipes that cannot be used together. For example, `typeorm-postgres` conflicts with `prisma` and `mongoose` because you should pick one ORM.
- **Requirements** — Recipes that depend on another recipe. For example, `auth-flows` requires `jwt-auth` because it builds on JWT-based authentication.
- **Compatibility** — Each recipe lists which project types it supports. Some recipes work with all project types; others are limited to HTTP APIs or specific architectures.

The CLI validates all three constraints before generating. If you select an incompatible combination, you get a clear error before anything touches disk.

## Smart Defaults

When you select a cloud provider, spoonfeeder pre-selects relevant recipes:

- **AWS** — Highlights AWS SQS, SNS, S3, Cognito, Secrets Manager, and other AWS services
- **GCP** — Highlights Pub/Sub, Cloud SQL, Firestore, Cloud Functions, and other GCP services
- **Azure** — Highlights Service Bus, Cosmos DB, Blob Storage, Functions, and other Azure services

You can add or remove any recipe from the defaults.

## Best Practices Recipes

Some recipes are selected by default for all project types because they represent best practices:

- **Helmet** — Security headers
- **CORS** — Cross-origin resource sharing
- **Rate Limiting** — Request throttling
- **Health Checks** — Liveness and readiness endpoints
- **Graceful Shutdown** — Clean connection draining

These can be deselected if they are not needed for your use case.
