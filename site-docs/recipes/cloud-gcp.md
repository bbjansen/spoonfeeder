# Cloud — GCP Recipes

Spoonfeeder provides 10 GCP recipes covering messaging, storage, databases, authentication, secrets, logging, caching, CDN, and serverless. Use these recipes when deploying to Google Cloud Platform infrastructure. Each recipe wraps an official `@google-cloud/*` client behind a NestJS injectable service.

All GCP recipes use the official `@google-cloud/*` packages with exact version pinning.

!!! tip "Recommended combinations"
    - **Typical API on GCP:** `gcp-cloud-storage` + `gcp-secret-manager` + `gcp-cloud-logging` + `gcp-cloud-sql`
    - **Event-driven architecture:** `gcp-pubsub` + `gcp-cloud-functions`
    - **Managed auth + caching:** `gcp-firebase-auth` + `gcp-memorystore`

!!! note "Application Default Credentials"
    All GCP recipes rely on Application Default Credentials (ADC). Set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` for local development or use Workload Identity on GKE. Avoid service account key files in production.

## GCP Pub/Sub

Google Cloud Pub/Sub messaging integration.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **ID** | `gcp-pubsub` |
| **Dependencies** | `@google-cloud/pubsub` |
| **Compatible with** | All project types |

**Environment variables:**

| --- | --- | --- |
| `GCP_PROJECT_ID` | | GCP project ID |
| `PUBSUB_TOPIC` | | Pub/Sub topic name |
| `PUBSUB_SUBSCRIPTION` | | Pub/Sub subscription name |

**Usage:** Use `PubSubService` to publish and subscribe to messages. Use ordering keys for ordered delivery. Enable dead-letter topics for failed messages.

!!! warning "Requires a GCP project"
    Pub/Sub is a managed GCP service. For local development, use the [Pub/Sub emulator](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/emulator).

**Pairs well with:** `gcp-cloud-functions`, `dead-letter-queue`
