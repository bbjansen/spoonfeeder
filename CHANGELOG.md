## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-19

### Added

#### Express Adapter Support
- Full Express adapter support across all HTTP project types (http-api, aws-lambda, full-stack, monorepo)
- Every recipe template is now adapter-aware with EJS conditionals for Express vs Fastify code paths
- Config validator rejects graphql-mercurius with Express adapter (Fastify-only)

#### Transport Layer Generation
- Microservice projects now generate transport-specific main.ts configuration for all 8 transports (TCP, Redis, NATS, MQTT, RabbitMQ, Kafka, gRPC, custom)
- Transport-specific npm dependencies automatically added (ioredis, kafkajs, nats, mqtt, amqplib, @grpc/grpc-js)
- Transport-specific environment variables in .env.example

#### Module Registration
- All 54 recipes with NestJS modules are now automatically imported into app.module.ts
- Created module wrappers for 8 service-only recipes (prisma, sendgrid, dead-letter-queue, feature-flags, graceful-shutdown, mfa-totp, transactional-outbox, webhooks)
- add-recipe generator now also applies moduleImport during post-generation recipe additions

#### Multi-Cloud Terraform
- Terraform deploy templates now generate cloud-appropriate resources (AWS ECS, GCP Cloud Run, Azure Container Apps)
- Backend configuration adapts to cloud provider (S3, GCS, azurerm)
- Provider blocks and variables are cloud-aware

#### Config Validation
- Recipe conflict validation (rejects conflicting ORM/logger/email combos)
- Recipe requires validation (rejects missing dependency chains)
- Recipe compatibleWith validation (rejects HTTP-only recipes on non-HTTP projects)
- Cross-cloud validation (rejects AWS recipes with GCP/Azure provider and vice versa)
- graphql-mercurius + Express rejection

#### Manifest Completeness
- .spoonfeed.json now records name, scope, httpAdapter, frontendFramework, transportLayer
- add-recipe reads all manifest fields for template rendering

#### Recipe Package Fragments
- Generator now loads recipe-level package-fragment.json files (for scripts like docs:dev)
- add-recipe and remove-recipe handle fragment scripts correctly

### Fixed

#### Generator
- Base package.json.ejs no longer leaks HTTP adapter devDependencies to non-HTTP project types
- HTTP-specific base files (exception filter, timeout middleware, e2e test) removed for non-HTTP projects
- Package.json merger deduplicates cross-section deps (runtime takes precedence over dev)
- Env merger produces deterministic output (sections sorted alphabetically, shared vars as comments)
- CLAUDE.md includes project name/scope, correct import alias for workspace projects, and workspace layout info
- Kubernetes manifests use project name instead of hardcoded "app"
- Dockerfile and docker-compose handle workspace layouts (full-stack/monorepo)

#### Recipe Definitions
- 13 HTTP-only recipes restricted from non-HTTP project types (cors, throttler, pagination, filtering, api-versioning, health-checks, opentelemetry, correlation-id, request-logging, csrf, http-caching, distributed-tracing, multi-tenancy)
- Bidirectional conflict declarations for ORM recipes, s3-minio/aws-s3, rabbitmq/bullmq
- @nestjs/microservices version fixed in rabbitmq recipe (v10 to v11)
- @nestjs/websockets and @nestjs/platform-socket.io fixed in websockets recipe (v10 to v11)
- Non-existent npm versions fixed (@grpc/grpc-js, mqtt)
- Deprecated conventional-changelog-cli replaced with conventional-changelog
- AI context Fastify-specific text neutralized in 4 recipes (helmet, cors, csrf, file-upload)

#### Add/Remove Recipe Lifecycle
- add-recipe respects Express adapter (uses expressDependencies and expressMainTsSetup)
- add-recipe copies template files and records them in manifest
- add-recipe loads recipe package-fragment.json for scripts
- add-recipe deduplicates env vars with shared-with comments
- add-recipe validates graphql-mercurius + Express
- add-recipe passes all 7 template data fields to EJS
- remove-recipe promotes shared env vars when owning recipe is removed
- remove-recipe removes fragment-contributed scripts
- remove-recipe protects import specifiers needed by other recipes
- Multi-line Prettier-formatted imports correctly removed

#### Migrate Recipe
- Fixed incomplete dependent satisfaction check (now simulates full post-migration set)
- Schema supports positional args for from/to

#### List Recipes
- Filters recipes by compatibleWith (incompatible recipes no longer shown as available)
- JSON output includes description, requires, compatibleWith

#### Post-Generate
- pnpm install uses --ignore-scripts (supply chain safety)
- git commit disables GPG signing for initial scaffolding commit

#### Templates
- EJS blank lines fixed with -%> trimming across 7 template files
- http-exception.filter unit test converted to adapter-aware EJS
- prefer-header interceptor uses correct Express API (response.status vs response.code)
- app.module.ts single-element imports formatted for prettier compliance
- docs-site recipe: added index.md, guide page, and package-fragment.json with scripts
- docs-site VitePress config: removed @ prefix from GitHub URLs

### Test Coverage
- 2114 unit and integration tests
- 31 integration test suites covering recipe definitions, cross-adapter diffs, non-HTTP projects, cloud providers, frontend frameworks, deployment/CI-CD, max recipe combos, transport layers, scoped names, template rendering, package.json integrity, config validation, default presets, add/remove/migrate lifecycle, and more
- Deep matrix: every HTTP-compatible recipe tested individually with both Fastify and Express adapters (227 tests)
- 45 heavy combo generate+install+compile tests across all project types, adapters, transports, and cloud providers
- 151 npm package versions verified against registry
- Generated project unit and e2e tests confirmed passing
